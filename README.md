A substitution Cipher were we encrypt the message by replacing every letter in the message by another letter (Key). It can be
decrypted as long the receiver of the message has the key. The key must contain 26 non-repeated alphabetical characters.

For example, a key string of QWERTYUIOPLKJHGFDSAZXCVBNM. This string of 26 charcters key means that letter 'A' (The first letter
of the alphabet) should turn into 'Q' (The first letter of the key string), letter 'B' (The second letter of the alphabet) should
turn into 'W' (The second letter of the key string) and so forth.

So, if we have a message like "Hello World", It would be encrypted as "Itkkg Vgskr", replacing each letter according to the mapping
of the key.

The encryption only works with alphabetical letters both lower and upper cases. Whitespaces, numbers, Punctuations and other non
alphabetical characters will remain the same and will not be encrypted in the message.
